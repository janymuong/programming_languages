# Programming Languages

> Computer Science - ICS 2204 Programming Languages: Coursework in differing contexts - assignments,  resources etc  

`ICS 2204 - Programming Languages` unit typically covers a range of topics related to programming languages and their usage. It is essentially a part of computer science used to understand how different programming languages work, how to design and use programming languages, and how to write efficient and effective code.

## Sample Concepts Covered:

1. **Intro to Programming Languages:** An overview of what programming languages are, their history, and their importance in computer science.

2. **Syntax and Semantics:** The study of the syntax and semantics of programming languages. This includes understanding how to write correct and meaningful code. How to define and use functions, methods, or procedures to organize code into reusable and modular components.

3. **Data Types and Variables:** Exploring different data types (e.g., integers, floats, strings, arrays) and how variables are declared and used in various programming languages.

4. **Control Structures:** Understanding control structures such as conditionals (`if-else` statements), loops (`for, while`), and branching.

5. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

6. Exploring further programming concepts like immutability, pure functions, higher-order functions, and lambda expressions.

7. `Parsing`, lexing, and compiling(if applicable) etc

8. **Type Systems:** Discussing static and dynamic typing, type inference, and the role of type systems in programming languages.
