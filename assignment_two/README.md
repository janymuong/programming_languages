>> Instructions for ASSIGNMENT 2:   


## PART A: `Data Types` Recap 

1. Adjust your Simple calculator app to a version that takes the year of birth of a person and 
calculates their age in years, months and days respectively. Your app should give all three 
outputs.
2. Create a tip calculator that takes in the total bill amount, the tip amount as a percentage of the total bill amount (10,12 or 15 should be the options) and the number of people 
splitting the bill. After getting these user input values your app should calculate the
amount each person should pay and display the answer rounded to two decimal points.  



## Part B: `Control Flow`
Read through the content on control flow and attempt the following code challenges.  

3. Create A BMI Calculator app. After calculating the BMI of a person, the calculator should 
inform the person if they are underweight, Normal weight or Overweight.
4. Create an app that takes an year as the input and informs you whether it is a leap year or 
not.
